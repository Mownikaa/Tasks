# Basic express assignment

Please do the express assignment as shown in the demo. The assignment is very crucial for the upcoming backend project.

<br>

# How to run the project:
1. Fork project and
2. run yarn or npm (depending on which package manager you are using)
3. yarn start or npm run start

<br>

# Requirements:

## Before you start coding, check out the existing code:
1. check index.ts to see how we run the server and create a `users` router
2. check the user routes: get all users and get individual
3. send request queries to get all users and one user by user id

<br>

## TODOs:
`after reading and practicing the existing code do the followings`:
1. continue the user route with tasks:
  * create new user
  * update user information (like name and/or age)
  * delete user

2. create new route for products (just like users - check index file)
  * create new product
  * get all products
  * get one product
  * update product
  * delete product

<br>

### Here are couple of screenshots for a successful request:

`a response for list of users`
